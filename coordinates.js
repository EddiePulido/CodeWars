// You are given the three corner points of a triangle as coordinates in the plane.
// Find the midpoint of the triangle given.

// The math:
// A triangle's midpoint is the point with the shortest possible sum of the distance to the three corners.
// Imagine drawing a line from any of the three corners to the middle point of the opposite side of the triangle. These three lines meet at a single point known as the triangle midpoint, geometric center, centroid, or middle point.
// Your task is to provide the coordinates of this middle point of the triangle given.
